# eta_routing

I currently have data saving to the database from the form. I am running up against issues with ng-repeat. Possibly because of the controller?
It could also be an issue with how I am trying to access the properties. I looked over documentation and help sites with no real result. I encountered
issues early on with collection creation/plurel names. I am hoping I am close and am just missing syntax.
